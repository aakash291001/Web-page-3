<h1>History</h1>
<p>Delhi Polytechnic

The seeds of Delhi Polytechnic were sowed by the Wood and Abott Committee of 1938. It was established as Delhi Polytechnic in 1941. The technical school was created to cater to the demands of Indian industries. At that time, Delhi Polytechnic offered courses in Arts, Architecture, Commerce, Engineering, Applied Science and Textiles. Walter William Wood, the father of technical education in India, became the founder Principal of Delhi Polytechnic.

The National Diploma awarded by Delhi Polytechnic was considered an equivalent to the B.E. Degree by the then UPSC. B.E. degrees in Mechanical Engineering, Electrical Engineering, Chemical Engineering and Textile Engineering were awarded to the students under Faculty of Technology, the University of Delhi since 1952. A B.E. degree in Civil Engineering was introduced in 1955. In addition to merit of the qualifying examination, tests and/or interviews were held for the selection of candidates for admission. </p>
